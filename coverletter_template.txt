To whom it may concern,

I'm writing to inquire about the opening for { job position title? }.

I offer {how many years exp?} years of experience, I have strong {which skills will you use?} which makes me a strong candidate for this opening. {which portion?} of my resume highlights my career profile and my significant accomplishments, which puts me in alignment with the position.

I'd welcome the opportunity to speak with you if you feel I'd be a strong candidate for this or any position in your organization.

Regards,
